# Check if a number is prime

It's guaranteed that input value **is always greater than 1** (i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5, ....). Use the provided template for your method.

>A prime number is a value greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. [More details are here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).
