# Extracting big numbers from a text

## Description
Write a program that extracts and outputs all big numbers from a string. A big number contains at least 10 characters.

Output all the big numbers you found. Each number should start with a new line and be followed by its length (the number of digits). Insert the colon `:` character to separate numbers and their lengths.

Try to use `Matcher` and `Pattern` to solve it. All the needed modules are already imported.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
If X is 609348676234, Y is 3077, the sum is 609348679311.
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
609348676234:12
609348679311:12
```
