# Template Method

## Description
Now, we'll add a new concrete class `Sandwich`

`Sandwich` is different from `Steak`, so that's why you need to implement it.

The first line of the standard input is the concrete meal.

You must output the meal procedure.

Please do not change the provided code of the classes.

## Example
**Sample Input:**
```console
Sandwich
```

**Sample Output:**
```console
Ingredients: bacon, white bread, egg, cheese, mayonnaise, tomato
Paste ingredients between bread slices. Toast sandwich
That's good
Lick fingers and go to sleep
```
