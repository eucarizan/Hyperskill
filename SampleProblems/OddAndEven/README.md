# Odd and even

## Description
Write a method that takes a `List` of `Integer` numbers and returns a `List` containing the same `Integer` numbers sorted according to the following rules:

In the sorted `List`, odd numbers should be at the beginning in ascending order and even numbers should be at the end in descending order. You don't need to read or write anything from or to the console, just implement the method.

Tip: The list may contain any non-null integer values

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
0 1 2 3 4 5

```console
1 3 5 4 2 0
```

**Sample Input 2:**

5 4 7 2 1 4
```
