# Numbers filtering

## Description
You have two `IntStream`'s. The first stream contains even numbers and the second stream contains odd numbers. Implement a method that returns the third stream that contains _sorted_ numbers from both streams which are divisible by 3 and 5 _without_ the first two numbers.

>You need to return a prepared `IntStream` from a template method, not a list of integers. Pay attention to the method template. Do not change the signature of this method.
