# Generating cats

## Description
You need to implement the `generateNCats` method to generate `n` identical cats. We are not kidding, we need exactly the same cats. You may ask why this might be useful, but this is a quite common situation when writing unit tests when you need objects with any values of their fields. This problem will be especially useful if you apply your knowledge of method / constructor references here.
