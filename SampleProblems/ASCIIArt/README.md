# ASCII Art

## Description
Implement the `asciiArt` method that takes the list of strings, joins them into a single string, and adds the `(` symbol at the beginning of the resulting string and `)` symbol at the end of the resulting string.

Remember to use the collect operation to solve the problem.

> You may find the `Collectors.joining` method particularly useful.
