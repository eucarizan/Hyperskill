# Counting words

## Description
Implement these two methods for a given array of string:

- `wordCount` that returns a `SortedMap<String, Integer>` where keys are all different strings and values are the number of times that string appears in the array. The method takes an array of strings as input;
- `printMap` that prints all entries of the map (`"key : value"`).


## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
a b b c d a b
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
a : 2
b : 3
c : 1
d : 1
```
