# Sum of divisors

## Description
For a given range from `a` to `b` both inclusive, count sum of numbers that are divisible by `n` or `m`. Use streams to solve the problem.

For example, for range from 10 to 20 and `n` = 2, `m` = 3, there are 7 numbers that are divisible by `n` or `m`: 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20. The sum of these numbers equals 105.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
10 20 2 3
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
105
```
