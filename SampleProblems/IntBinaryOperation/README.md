# IntBinaryOperation

## Description
You are given an abstract class `IntBinaryOperation`. It has one abstract method `perform()` and two fields representing the operation arguments. The fields are initialized in the constructor. See the provided code template.

You need to declare and implement two classes representing concrete operations: `Addition` and `Multiplication`. The classes must extend the abstract class and implement the method `perform()`. The implementations should work in accordance with the class name. Do not forget to write two-argument constructors in your classes.

Do NOT make your classes `public`.
