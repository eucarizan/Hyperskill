# Publication and its subclasses


## Description
You are given four classes â€” `Publication`, `Newspaper`, `Article` and `Announcement`. You need to override the methods `getType()` and `getDetails()` in classes inherited from the class Publication.

Then you need to implement `getInfo()` in the class `Publication` using `getType()` and `getDetails()`. The method should return a `String` with a type of publication in the first place, then details in round brackets and the title after a colon. Examples are shown below.
