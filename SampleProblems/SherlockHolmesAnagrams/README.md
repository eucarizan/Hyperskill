#  Sherlock Holmes and the mystery of anagrams

## Description
In this problem, you are Sherlock Holmes and you want to quickly detect all anagrams.

Write a program that finds out whether two words are anagrams or not. If one word is an anagram of another, print **"yes"**, else print **"no"**.

**Note**: anagrams are words that contain the same characters with the same frequencies. In other words, anagrams are created by changing the order of letters in the word.

For example:

- "**ppaaagg**" (2 **p**s, 3 **a**s, 2 **g**s) and "**gagaapp**" (2 **p**s, 3 **a**s, 2 **g**s) are anagrams;
- "**hello**" (1 **h**, 1 **e**, 2 **l**s, 1 **o**) and "**helllo**" (1 **h**, 1 **e**, 3 **l**s, 1 **o**) are not anagrams.

**Remember**: anagrams are case-insensitive.

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
ppaaagg
gagaapp
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
yes
```
