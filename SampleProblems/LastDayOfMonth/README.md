# The last day of a month

## Description
We normally speak of a day by addressing a month, for example, August 30. Another way to indicate a day is to give an order number to each day in a year. Then we could say, for example, "242nd day of the year".

Write a program that reads a year and the number of a day in this year, and checks if the day is the last day of a month or not.

The program must output either "**true**" or "**false**".

## Examples
**Sample Input 1:**
```console
2017 31
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```console
true
```
