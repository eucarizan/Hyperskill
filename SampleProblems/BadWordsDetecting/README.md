# Bad words detecting

## Description
You need to implement a method that returns a prepared stream for detecting bad words. The method has two parameters:

- a text in which all words are divided by single whitespaces;
- a list of all possible bad words.

The method must return a stream of all unique bad words present in the text, in lexicographical order (like in a dictionary).
