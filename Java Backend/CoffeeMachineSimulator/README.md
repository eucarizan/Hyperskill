## Learning outcomes
Program a virtual barista to get a taste of Java. You'll create a functional program and gain experience in working on complex coding tasks.

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

## Stages
### 1: Making coffee
#### 1.1 Description
Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

#### 1.2 Objective
The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

#### 1.3 Example
Take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

Output:
```
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
```
