## Learning outcomes
The project covers basic operations on integers, as well as with collections. Make a program that indicates the properties of the numbers taken from the input.

## About
We use numbers every day. But do you know how many different properties they have? Let's take a look at some of the amazing properties of numbers. After completing this project, you will write a program that knows how to determine whether a number is Palindromic or Gapful, or how to distinguish Spy numbers from others. Numbers can be fascinating!

## Stages
### 1: Buzz numbers
#### 1.1 Description
Integers can be even or odd. All numbers that end with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even; the rest are odd. However, numbers have many other properties, you will learn about some of them in this project.

First, let's talk about **Buzz numbers**. They are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. For example, the number 14 is a buzz number, since it is divisible by 7 without a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, so it is also a buzz number. However, the number 75 is not a Buzz number, since it is neither divisible by 7 nor does it end with 7. The number 7 is a Buzz number too.

Your task at this stage is to write a program that prints the natural number parity and determines whether this number is a Buzz. The program should print why this number is a Buzz number.

Do you know how to determine whether a number is divisible by 7 or not? We have a great tip:

1. Remove the last digit;
2. Multiply the removed digit by 2 and subtract it from the remaining number.
3. If the result of the subtraction can be divided by 7, then the initial number is divisible by 7. You can apply the whole sequence multiple times until you get a relatively small/easy-to-interpret subtraction result.

For example, take 196. We remove the last digit and get 19. We subtract 12 (the removed digit multiplied by 2) to get 7. Since the last left digit is 7, the number is multiple of 7. So 196 is a Buzz number!

You can use any solution you want, the tests won't check it.

#### 1.2 Objectives
Your program should check whether the given natural number is a buzz number.

1. Ask a user to enter a natural number.
2. If the number is not natural, print an error message.
3. Calculate and print the parity of the number.
4. Check whether is the number is a Buzz number and print the explanation.
5. Finish the program after printing the message.

Natural numbers are whole numbers starting from 1.

Explanations:
```console
... is neither divisible by 7 nor does it end with 7
```
```console
... is divisible by 7
```
```console
... ends with 7
```
```console
... is divisible by 7 and ends with 7
```

Error message:
```console
This number is not natural!
```

#### 1.3 Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
> 13
This number is Odd.
It is not a Buzz number.
Explanation:
13 is neither divisible by 7 nor does it end with 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
> 14
This number is Even.
It is a Buzz number.
Explanation:
14 is divisible by 7.
```

**Example 3:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
> 17
This number is Odd.
It is a Buzz number.
Explanation:
17 ends with 7.
```

**Example 4:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
> 7
This number is Odd.
It is a Buzz number.
Explanation:
7 is divisible by 7 and ends with 7.
```

**Example 5:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
-76
This number is not natural!
```

### 2: Duck numbers
#### 2.1 Description
Your next task is to determine whether a number is a **Duck number**. A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 321**0**, 8**0**5**0**896, 7**0**7**0**9 are Duck numbers. Note that a number with a leading 0 is not a Duck number. So, numbers like 035 or 0212 are not Duck numbers. Although, 012**0**3 is a Duck, since it has a trailing 0.

In this stage, we need to simplify the way we display the information. We already have several properties that we need to show; we are going to add new features to our program in each stage. From now on, the card should follow this notation:

```console
Properties of {number}
{property}: true/false
{property}: true/false
...
{property}: true/false
```

In this stage, the properties are `even`, `odd`, `buzz` and `duck`. For `14`, the program output should look like this:

```console
Properties of 14
        even: true
         odd: false
        buzz: true
        duck: false
```

The property order, indentation, and spaces are not checked by the tests. The tests are also case-insensitive.

#### 2.3 Objectives
Your program should print the properties of a natural number. In this stage, your program should:

1. Ask a user to enter a natural number;
2. If the number is not natural, the program should print an error message;
3. If the number is natural, the program should indicate the properties of the number;
4. Finish the program after printing the message.

#### 2.3 Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
> -7
This number is not natural!
```

**Example 2:**
```console
Enter a natural number:
> 15
Properties of 15
        even: false
         odd: true
        buzz: false
        duck: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Enter a natural number:
> 14
Properties of 14
        even: true
         odd: false
        buzz: true
        duck: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Enter a natural number:
> 102
Properties of 102
        even: true
         odd: false
        buzz: false
        duck: true
```

### 3: Palindromic numbers
#### 3.1 Description
In this stage, the program should check whether a number is a **Palindromic** one. A Palindromic number is symmetrical; in other words, it stays the same regardless of whether we read it from left or right. For example, 17371 is a palindromic number. 5 is also a palindromic number. 1234 is not. If read it from right, it becomes 4321. Add this new property to our program.

In previous stages, the program could process only one number. From now on, the program should accept a request from a user, analyze and execute it. The program should print Enter a request instead of asking for a natural number. The program should also continue execution unless a user enters a terminate command. Let's make it 0 (zero).

Your program should welcome users and print the instructions. At this point, make your program execute two commands. If a user enters a natural number, the program should indicate the properties of that number. If a user enters zero, then the program should exit. If a user enters a negative number by mistake, print an error message.

#### 3.2 Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. Terminate the program if a user enters zero;
5. If a number is not natural, print an error message;
6. Print the properties of the natural number;
7. Continue execution from step 3, after the request has been processed.

The properties are `even`, `odd`, `buzz`, `duck` and `palindromic`. The tests won't check the order of properties, indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like. Please, add the information below:

**Instructions:**
```console
Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter 0 to exit.
```

**Error message:**
```console
The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.
```

#### 3.3 Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```console
Welcome to Amazing Numbers!

Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter 0 to exit.

Enter a request: > 9223372036854775807

Properties of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
        even: false
         odd: true
        buzz: true
        duck: true
 palindromic: false

Enter a request: > 101

Properties of 101
        even: false
         odd: true
        buzz: false
        duck: true
 palindromic: true

Enter a request: > -56

The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.

Enter a request: > 0

Goodbye!
```

### 4: Gapful numbers
#### 4.1 Description
In this stage, we are going to add one more property â€” **Gapful numbers**. It is a number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit **without a remainder**. 12 is not a Gapful number, as it has only two digits. 132 is a Gapful number, as **1**3**2** % 12 == 0. Another good example of a Gapful number is 7881, as **7**88**1** % 71 == 0.

Until this stage, the program could process only one number at a time. Now, a user should be able to enter two numbers to obtain the properties of a list of numbers. Separate the numbers with one space. Space separates the first number in the list and the length of the list. For, example. 100 2 tells the program to process two numbers: 100 and 101. 1 100 means that the program is about to process 100 numbers, starting from 1. If a user enters one number, the program should work the same as in the previous stages. The program should analyze a number and print its properties. As before, if a user enters a single 0 (zero), terminate the program. Information about each number should be printed in one line in the following format:

```
             140 is even, buzz, duck, gapful
             141 is odd, palindromic
```

So, the format is `{number} is {property}, {property}, ... {property}`

#### 4.2 Objectives
Your program should process various user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters zero, terminate the program;
5. If a user enters an empty request, print the instructions;
6. If numbers are not natural, print an error message;
7. If one number is entered, calculate and print the properties of this number;
8. For two numbers, print the list of numbers with properties;
9. Once the request is processed, continue execution from step 3.

In the current stage, the property names include `even`, `odd`, `buzz` , `duck`, `palindromic` and `gapful`. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like. Please, add the information below:

**Instructions**
```
Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter two natural numbers to obtain the properties of the list:
  * the first parameter represents a starting number;
  * the second parameter shows how many consecutive numbers are to be printed;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.
```

**Error messages**
```
The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.
```
```
The second parameter should be a natural number.
```

#### 4.3 Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```console

             106 is duck, even
             107 is buzz, duck, odd
             108 is duck, gapful, even
             109 is duck, odd

Enter a request: > exit

The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.

Enter a request: >

  * the first parameter represents a starting number;
  * the second parameter shows how many consecutive numbers are to be processed;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.

Enter a request: > 0

Goodbye!

Process finished with exit code 0
```

### 5: Spy numbers
#### 5.1 Description
In this stage, we will add another property that is called a **Spy number**. A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.

Our program calculates the properties of numbers, and also knows how to process a list of numbers. But what if we want to find numbers that have a certain property? For example, in case we want to find ten Buzz numbers starting from 1000. We need to add a new request feature for this. In addition, add a new property â€” Spy numbers. These numbers hide well, so beware. Your task is to modify the program so that it can search for these numbers.

#### 5.2 Objectives
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters zero, terminate the program;
5. If numbers are not natural, print an error message;
6. If a user inputs an incorrect property, print the error message and the list of available properties;
7. For one number, print the properties of the number;
8. For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties;
9. For two numbers and a property, print the list of numbers and their properties filtered by the indicated property;
10. Once a request is processed, continue execution from step 3.

In the current stage, the property names include `even`, `odd`, `buzz`, `duck`, `palindromic` , `gapful`, and `spy`. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like. Please, add the information below:

**Instructions**
```
Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter two natural numbers to obtain the properties of the list:
  * the first parameter represents a starting number;
  * the second parameter shows how many consecutive numbers are to be printed;
- two natural numbers and a property to search for;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.
```

**Error messages**
```
The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.
```
```
The second parameter should be a natural number.
```
```
The property [SUN] is wrong.
Available properties: [EVEN, ODD, BUZZ, DUCK, PALINDROMIC, GAPFUL, SPY]
```

#### 5.3 Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```console

Enter a request: bye

The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.

Enter a request: 0

Goodbye!

Process finished with exit code 0
```


### 6: Sunny and Square numbers
#### 6.1 Description
N is a **sunny** number if N+1 is a **perfect square** number. In mathematics, a square number or a perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it equals 32 and can be written as 3Ã—3.

Our program can search for Spy and Palindromic numbers. What if we want to find all even Spy numbers? Or find all odd numbers among Palindromic numbers? Are there any Palindromics that are also Spies? In this stage, you will add the ability to search for several properties at once!

What if a user enters the same property twice by mistake? For example, they want to find all even numbers that are even? Just ignore this duplicate property. What about two mutually exclusive properties? For example, if a user wants to find even numbers that are odd. In this case, the program will initiate the search, but there are no such numbers. We need to make our program foolproof. If a request contains mutually exclusive properties, the program should abort this request and warn the user. There are three pairs of mutually exclusive properties. A request cannot include **Even and Odd, Duck and Spy, Sunny and Square** numbers.

#### 6.2 Objectives
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters zero, terminate the program;
5. If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
6. If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
7. For one number, calculate and print the properties of the number;
8. For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties;
9. For two numbers and one property, print the numbers with this property only;
10. For two numbers and two properties, print the numbers that have both properties.
11. If a user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn a user.
12. Once a request has been processed, continue execution from step 3.

In the current stage, the property names include `even`, `odd`, `buzz` , `duck`, `palindromic` , `gapful` , `spy`, `square`, and `sunny`. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like. Please, add the information below:

**Instructions**

### 7: Jumping numbers
#### 7.1 Description
A number is a **Jumping number** if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers, but 796 and 89098 are not.

In this stage, we will also remove the limitation on pending properties in a request. The program knows how to calculate ten properties of numbers, and it would be strange to limit the query to just two properties. Let's remove this limitation. Let the program indicate all properties for all numbers in the request.

#### 7.2 Objectives
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters zero, terminate the program;
5. If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
6. If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
7. For one number, print the properties of the number;
8. For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties.
9. For two numbers and properties, print the numbers with the specified properties;
10. If a user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user;
11. Once a request has been processed, continue execution from step 3.

In the current stage, the property names include `even`, `odd`, `buzz`, `duck`, `palindromic`, `gapful`, `spy`, `square`, `sunny`, and `jumping`. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like.

**Instructions**
```
