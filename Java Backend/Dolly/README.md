## About
In 1996 The Roslin Institute from Scotland cloned a sheep called Dolly. A big step in the history of humankind. You don't need to clone a sheep in this project, don't worry. Instead of Dolly, clone a remote repository. A clone is a copy of a repository, created in a new directory. The aim is usually to make a local copy of a remote repository that is hosted on a third-party service. After this, you can work on your local copy, make changes, and push the changes back.
