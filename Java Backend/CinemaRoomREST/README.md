## Learning outcomes
In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theater. It will handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services, and respond with JSON objects.

## About
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!

## Stages
### 1: The show begins
#### 1.1 Description
There are many fun activities on the planet Earth, and one of them is going to the movies. It is arguably the most accessible, inclusive, and fulfilling entertainment. Bring your friends or loved ones â€” each movie is a whole new adventure waiting to be experienced.

Let's make our virtual movie theater with the help of a REST service. Our movie theater has 9 rows with 9 seats each. In this stage, you need to create a simple endpoint that will return the information about the cinema in JSON format.

#### 1.2 Objectives
Implement the `/seats` endpoint that handles `GET` requests and returns the information about the movie theatre.

The response should contain information about the rows, columns, and available seats. The response is a JSON object and has the following format:

```json
{
   "total_rows":5,
   "total_columns":6,
   "available_seats":[
      {
         "row":1,
         "column":1
      },

      ........

      {
         "row":5,
         "column":5
      },
      {
         "row":5,
         "column":6
      }
   ]
}
```

Our cinema room has 9 rows with 9 seats each, so the total number of respective rows and columns also amounts to 9 each.

Note that the `available_seats` array contains 81 elements, as there are 81 seats in the room.

#### 1.3 Examples
**Example 1:** _a `GET /seats` request_
*Response body:*

```json
{
   "total_rows":9,
   "total_columns":9,
   "available_seats":[
      {
         "row":1,
         "column":1
      },
      {
         "row":1,
         "column":2
      },
      {
         "row":1,
         "column":3
      },

      ........

      {
         "row":9,
         "column":8
      },
      {
         "row":9,
         "column":9
      }
   ]
}
```
