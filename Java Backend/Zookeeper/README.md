## Learning outcomes
This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as arrays, and while loops.

## About
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

## Stages
### 1: Rush into print
#### 1.1 Description
```
You need Java 17 to complete this project since it uses Text Blocks feature that is not present in Java 11. Remember to choose Java 17 when opening the project in the IDE.
```

There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for our large zoo, so one of your employers has suggested a more convinient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being able to check on each habitat would help the zookeepers take care of our furry friends more efficiently!

In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeepers check on the animals and make sure that they're doing well. Your product will be able to process commands from the zookeepers and display the animals on a monitor.

#### 1.2 Objectives
To begin with, you will develop a simple printer. Your program should display the text from the output example.

#### 1.3 Example
The output:
```console
I love animals!
Let's check on the animals...
The deer looks fine.
The bat looks happy.
The lion looks healthy.
```
